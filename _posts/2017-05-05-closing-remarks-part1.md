Every once in a while, it becomes really hard to write a new post. Sometimes that's because it's hard to find time, or there is no motivation, or maybe there's no easy way to formulate and corral all of the thoughts, feelings, and events that are forthcoming.

That last reason describes this post. It's been over a month since my last post, and so much has and is happening.

Graduation is almost here – a week and a day away – and I think it could go without saying that reminiscing has been more frequent lately. Where to start...

The senior show was last Friday, and it could not have been a more resounding success. The recruiters has an absolute blast playing _Office Mayhem_, and there's [even a picture of Don Laackman](https://twitter.com/officemayhem/status/858699193803845633), president of Champlain College, enjoying the game. The team finished the win screen, including balloon popping. It's quite a lot of fun:

The build is in a great place, and we actually have interest from multiple publishers to release the game. It has only put an even better end-cap to my experience at Champlain. I don't think I'm ready to write that blog post yet.

Working with the _Office Mayhem_ team has been the best team experience I've had at Champlain, and I hope I've made that clear across the plethora of blog posts I've written about them and the game. I am excited to see what we make of _Office Mayhem_, and I wish them nothing but the best. They're an extremely talented lot, and I know they will succeed in whatever they strive for.

In other news, [David](wednesdavid.xyz) and I finished our physics demonstration, which was to implement volume and point based fields. I'm hoping to get a write-up of that on my portfolio in the coming weeks. I also have been slowly working on _DASHockey_ in my free time, though the more progress I make the more I am unsure of its viability. I'm also working on a sample project showcasing [Action]() – currently it is in its infancy, but I'm excited to explore what I can do with it.

With all of that said, I could not be happier, or more excited, to announce that I was offered and accepted a position at Vicarious Visions as a junior software engineer. I am so humbled to join their team and am itching to start working.

Part 2 will be in a week or so, after graduation, and will be much more emotionally fueled. Until then, I'm off to enjoy this last week to its utmost.
